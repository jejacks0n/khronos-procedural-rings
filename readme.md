# Procedural "HyperRings"

#### Presented by Khronos, Helmet & Schwartz MFG Limited

Using duct tape, some scrap struts and not-so-top-of-the-line panels, a specialized team of special specialists will build a "HyperRing" sized to your exact needs. This of course happens in an alternate time stream.


## Notes

This project is incomplete, and not useful yet.


## Installation

[Download](https://github.com/jejacks0n/khronos-procedural-rings/archive/master.zip), extract, and place `Assets/Khronos` in `GameData` path.


## Usage

1. Place a HyperRing Hub - they come in 0.625m, 1.25m, and 2.5m sizes.
2. Hover over the hub and while pressing the `r` key, move your mouse to adjust the ring radius.
3. Once you have the radius desired you can add a HyperRing Strut. The struts come in a few flavors, can be placed with different symmetries and at angles for various effects, so play around.
4. Once the struts have been placed they will be magically lengthened to the specified radius and a toroid will be created connected to the struts and creating the HyperRing.
5. As a final step you can hover over the toroid and make further adjustments to its shape. Use the `w` key to adjust the width, and `h` to adjust height.


## Screenshots

This isn't a real screenshot, but it's part of the inspiration.. And when it all works and I can make screenshots this will be replaced with real ones.
